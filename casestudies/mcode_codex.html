      <h2>The mCODE Standard and CodeX Community</h2>
        
      
      <h3>mCODE Standard</h3>
      <p>mCODE is a <strong>standard</strong>, FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) capturing a core set of common data elements for cancer that is computable, clinically applicable and available in every electronic health record for patients with a cancer diagnosis.</p>
      <img src="../images/mcode-cancer-ring.png" width="500" class="py-5" alt="" />
      <h3>CodeX Community</h3> 
      <p>CodeX is a Member-driven HL7 FHIR Accelerator hosting a growing <strong><em>community</strong></em> working together to enable the  needed to drive substantial improvements around the most important challenges health. Initial CodeX Use Cases (projects) focused on improving, collecting, and sharing mCODE-based data to improve cancer care and research.</p>
      <img src="../images/codex-vision.png" width="500" class="py-5" alt="" />

      <h2>How it started</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>History 2017-2018</h3>
        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> The lucky spark was a chance encounter between former medical colleagues, Dr. Jay Schnitzer and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, on an airplane in 2017. Bertagnolli was a preeminent cancer surgeon at Brigham and Women’s and was leading the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Alliance for Cancer Trials in Oncology (ACTO). Dr. Schnitzer, was Chief Technology Officer at MITRE, with a growing portfolio of health information technology research.</p>
        <p>They had each been circling around one of the most fundamental root cause problems in healthcare:  Lack of a single standard for collecting and sharing cancer patient data electronically.  Drs. Bertagnolli and Schnitzer partnered to start a new data standard : the minimal Common Oncology Data Elements FHIR Implementation Guide (mCODE IG).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>ASCO and MITRE, led by Drs. Bertagnolli and Schnitzer, became what we now call <a href="../playbook/community.html#champions">Champions</a>. As <strong>Champions</strong>, they:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Committed their leadership</li>
          <li>Offered many of the key <strong>capabilities</strong> needed to start and succeed:
            <ul>
              <li>ASCO and ACTO – clinical </li>
              <li>MITRE – <strong>standards</strong> and systems engineering </li>
              <li>Both – convening power</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Had access to potential members of the <strong>community</strong> and the resources needed develop and leverage mCODE: 
            <ul>
              <li>ASCO and ACTO –  access to almost all clinical cancer organizations and vendors</li>
              <li>MITRE –  deep expertise in standards and systems engineering</li>
              <li>Both –  strong links to Federal health agencies.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p><strong>Vision:</strong> Drs. Bertagnolli and Schnitzer and an increasing number of additional partners envisioned data standards there were necessary and foundational for achieving a Learning Health System. In a Learning Health System, each interaction between a patient and clinician results in high-quality data controlled by patients and usable as each patient wishes by future caregivers, researchers, and others. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p><strong>Champions</strong> shared a common vision, providing a framework for future action.</p>

    <h2>mCODE First Use Case</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>History 2018-2019</h3>
        <p>First Use Case:  EHR Endpoints for Cancer Clinical Trials (ICAREdata study). This project aimed to capture and share, using the mCODE standard, high quality clinical treatment data within electronic health records (EHRs) that could be used for oncology research.</p>
        <p>ACTO and MITRE became the ICAREdata Use Case Champions. Over time, multiple health systems, clinical trials, Epic, NCI and FDA participated in, hosted, and/or funded development and testing.</p>  
        <p>Initial focus was on standardizing and collecting just three key data elements (cancer type, disease status (e.g., progressing, stable...), reason for treatment change) all modeled within the fledgling mCODE IG.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>ACTO, and MITRE understood that the best way to develop a cancer data standard is to focus on the small set of core data elements needed for specific Use Cases (e.g., specific challenges) that, if empowered by standardized data, could have a substantial impact.</p>
        <p>ACTO and ASCO’s credibility and clinical network facilitated engagement of outstanding clinical experts and vendors.</p>
        <p>Adoption and Value in real-world settings was in the Plan from the start. This ultimately helped refine mCODE and workflows and led to greater participation and substantial funding.</p>
        <p>This Use Case also helped identify the skillsets necessary during different phases of Use Case work.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p><b>mCODE Design:</b>  The ICAREdata Use Case provided helped establish an approach and structure for mCODE (around patient, assessments, disease, treatment, outcomes, genomics), and design principles.</p>
      <p><b>mCODE V 1.0 IG</b> was balloted in the Health Level Seven (HL7) standards organization in 2019, and benefited substantially from the ICAREdata experience.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>mCODE design principles that became clear during the ICAREdata Use Case included the following and have served mCODE’s evolution since [NOTE: See next slide]. Principles include:  Focus on discrete data collect during patient encounters. Collect clinical input first and engage clinical experts as specific review points for the IG. Base the IG on government and industry requirements and trends (e.g., FHIR, US Core). Leverage the best existing clinical data modeling efforts. Adopt global standard code systems. (More details in this <a href="../playbook/standards.html#design">design principles table</a>.</p>

    <h2>Starting the Community</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>History 2019-2020</h3>
        <p><b>Cancer Data Summit</b>: Interest in mCODE was starting to grow and new Use Cases were being proposed. A small group of leaders from across the oncology space (patients, providers, researchers, payers, gov’t agencies, vendors, etc.) convened for two days in October 2019 to brainstorm on the future of standardized cancer data, obstacles that could be prevent success, and next steps. [NOTE: see next slide] Support for creating a clinical requirements group (became the mCODE Executive Committee) and an implementation group (became CodeX).  See below.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>The Summit provided substantial benefits. Extremely useful feedback was provided by a diverse set of leaders. Noticeable alignment between diverse views happened during the two day event. Strategies for next steps were shared. Many who attended the Summit expressed interested in staying involved, and many of those became Champions and participants in the future mCODE Executive Committee and CodeX Community.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p><b>mCODE Executive Committee and Technical Review Group</b>: This body was organized under the leadership of ASCO, and included clinical leaders and experts from major cancer-related societies, government agencies, and others as needed.  The mandate continues to be to maintain and evolve the clinical description of the data elements in mCODE.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>It has proven beneficial to have this strictly clinical group focusing on clinical requirements and interpretation. An expert can be an invaluable contributor to mCODE, without being deeply involved in the technical and logistical work of that CodeX would take on. However, a valuable, small subset of those involved in Executive Committee have joined CodeX work.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p><b>CodeX Community</b> To complement the Executive Committee’s clinical leadership, MITRE led the creation of CodeX within HL7’s just launched Accelerator Program. CodeX was established, and still operates, with a focus on implanting FHIR IGs into software and workflows, testing these in the field, and supporting adoption and value measurement in the real world. A lightweight process, governance structure [NOTE:  See slide 143] and Membership fee model  [NOTE: See slide 144] were established. There were 9 Founding Members and other categories Members by the end of 2020.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>Establishing the goal of adoption and value of a standard, rather than focusing primarily on standards development, was and is not easy.  This generally takes a greater commitment of resources and time from more parts of the community to achieve the goal. However, this goal resonated with the growing community, and ultimately paid off in new Use Cases, Members, adoption and value in the real world.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p><b>Initial Vendor Implementation:</b> Epic and others started to implement parts of mCODE in their software, and delivering to their customers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>Demand for mCODE from large cancer centers (through ASCO, ACTO and the Summit) contributed substantially to vendors responding to their customers.</p>

    <h2>Delivering Demonstrable Value</h2>
    <p>In less than 5 years, the CodeX Community and other adopters have demonstrated the value of levering the mCODE standard for data collection and sharing to the point where all oncology stakeholders are seeing the it’s value and requesting it’s support from vendors. As of early 2024, there are numerous examples of mCODE’s success.  </p>
    <h3>Vendor Adoption</h3>
    <img src="../images/industry-implementing-codex.png" width="600" class="py-5" alt="" />
    <p>*Numbers are based on what the team has heard directly. There may be additional independent efforts adopting the CodeX FHIR standards</p>

    <h2>Conclusions from the mCODE / CodeX Case Study</h2>
    <p>Between 2019 and 2024, the CodeX Community and colleagues improved and leveraged mCODE to address difficult problems in oncology, substantially improving cancer care and research. The cardiology and genomics communities are starting their CodeX journey. For additional, new specialties considering following the mCODE / CodeX experience, here the five most important first steps to consider:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strong Community Champions Drive Success
        <ul>
	<li>        Champions are the most important key to the steps below. Champions understand needs, reach large constituencies, and mobilize resources.</li>
	<li>Leading medical professional societies and Government organizations have been the successful CodeX Champions.</li>
	<li>Must commit to the approach, to leading a project that grows in complexity and participation, and to helping to find skills and funding.</li>
</ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>Effective Governance facilitates communications, decision making, project management, resource distribution 
      <ul>
	<li>      Must be lightweight, with focus on providing infrastructure, starting use cases, adjudicating concerns, and applying funding to projects (sparingly).</li>
	<li>The CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator serves this purpose for Use Cases around cancer (mCODE standard), cardiovascular disease, and genomics, so far. Other governance schemes are possible but would require more effort to startup and engage across specialties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use Cases help prioritize effort into manageable segments 
<ul>
	<li>Each Use Case includes a specific health IT or process challenge that (a) attracts more participants into the community, (b) defines, validates, and/or motivates improvements to underlying workflows and standards, and (c) motivates demand, adoption, and value. Data are collected and shared using the same standard for multiple use cases.</li>
	<li>Initial CodeX Use Cases often start with “lower-bar” problems around which many stakeholders can align (2b). Use Cases can grow in scope over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Plan for Adoption & Value from the start 
<ul>
	<li>Each Use Case needs a pragmatic approach that envisions how the resulting solution will improve care and/or reduce burden.</li>
	<li>Engagement of future users who require (e.g., gov’t agencies) and/or demand (e.g., customers) vendors to implement solutions has proved invaluable in CodeX.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Resources Fuel Execution 
<ul>
	<li>Starting Use Cases and demonstrating solutions require specific types of organizations, skillsets, and often financing – at the right times.</li>
	<li>Resource requirements are typically less clear at the start but become clearer as work evolves.</li>
	<li>Use Case scope and timelines can be scaled to available resources and still be successful.</li>
	<li>Initial, rapid, promising Use Case results help attract and justify involvement of organizations, gathering the needed skillsets, and securing funding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
