      <h2>Building Community</h2>
      <p class="lead">Gathering the right organizations and people has been the most foundational and challenging track in the MITRE Interoperabilty Playbook.</p>
      <p>It’s very likely that almost everyone reviewing this site agrees that enabling true health data interoperability is more a social challenge, than a medical or technical challenge. It takes people who share a vision and mission, can align different views of how to get there, and invest the resources needed to change the status quo and gain sustainable growth and momentum. </p>

      <p>Actions that <%= link_to("CodeX","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %> has found indispensable include (a) Engaging Champions, (b) Establishing Good Governance, and (c) Growing the Community.  These actions are expanded upon below.</p>

      <h3 id="champions">Champions</h3>
      <p>An essential first step is to gather specialty Champions. The specialty as a whole and each Use Case (projects) within the specialty initiative need Champions.</p>
      <p>In CodeX, Champions are organizations and individuals who:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Commit to lead</li>
      <li>Understand the challenges for which data interoperability would help</li>
      <li>Believe the overall vision approach is a key part of future solutions, e.g. collect patient data once, and directly use as consented for many purposes (graphic at right).</li>
      <li>Command the attention of their larger community and can influence the future users and stakeholders to engage</li>
      <li>Motivate vendor implementation of new standards for tested Use Cases</li>
      <li>Motivate the change needed to use and benefit from of the standards-based systems in use in health processes</li>
      <li>Muster the resources needed to succeed</li>
      <li>Drive one more key tracks of the initiative: Community Engagement, Use Case Prioritization, Standards Development, Implementation & Pilots, Adoption & Value</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>It's clear that Champions have significant responsibilities.  But they also realize future benefits in terms of defining direction, achieving objectives, and ultimately improving health care and research. </p>
      <p>Large, medical professional societies and Government organizations have been the most frequent CodeX Champions for most Use Cases, but other stakeholders have also been effective Champions. The founding CodeX Champions were <%= link_to("American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)","https://www.asco.org") %>, with reach to all oncologists and centers; and <%= link_to("The MITRE Corporation","https://www.mitre.org") %>, with deep expertise in convening, FHIR standards and systems engineering. </p>



      <h3 id="governance">Governance</h3>
      <p>An organizational framework is important for any initiative involving many organizations, often with divergent interests and views. Views and interests need to be heard and understood. Decisions need to be taken. Example decisions include updates to the Governance structure itself, Membership structure and fees, adjudicating conflicts, administrative support, starting new Use Case work, and providing funding and resources to projects in special cases when the Community can’t. </p>
      <p>CodeX Accelerator provides the Governance for Use Cases around cancer (and the <%= link_to("mCODE standard","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %>), cardiovascular disease, and genomics, so far. Other governance schemes are possible but would require more effort to start and to coordinate effectively across specialties.  </p>
      <p>The graphic below captures the CodeX Governance structure as of 2024.  The tiered structure offers participation different of levels of responsibility and time commitment.  Details of the current <%= link_to("CodeX Governance scheme can be found on their website.","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/Governance")%></p>

      <p><%= image_tag 'governance_structure.png', :width => '100%', :class => 'py-5' %></p>
  
      <p>A few points regarding CodeX Governance: Major decisions are made by the elected Steering Committee. The vast majority of all Community effort is within the Use Case projects.  The Community of Practice (near bottom of graphic) is open to the public and has been an effective feeder of new organizations and talents into CodeX membership and Use Cases. One of the key “External Expert Groups” (circle on right) is the mCODE Executive Committee and its Technical Review Group. This Committee provides most of the subject matter expertise across oncology fields that ensure the mCODE FHIR Implementation Guide is based on the most credible and recent clinical knowledge.</p>
      <p>A strategy for sustaining work of the initiative is important.  Success is not achieved overnight. In CodeX, the range of skills (and sometimes money) needed to drive each Use Case, is provided by participants. Funding for Program Management (near top of the graphic above) is largely from Membership fees.  The Member fee structure as of 2024 can be seen below, with the current fee structure on the CodeX site. Based on 2024 CodeX Membership (current list is here), Membership fees provide about $800K (USD) annually - largely to support Program Management.</p>

      <h3 id="growth">Community Growth</h3>
      <p>For Use Case projects to progress from a vision to adoption and value in the real world, a variety of organizations and skillsets are needed. Thus, the community must be grown such that there are participants with direct experience related to each of the envisioned roles Use Cases.</p>
      <p>For example, in the CodeX Radiation Therapy Case Study, the team included radiation therapy societies, health systems, radiation oncologists, radiation physicists, payers, and vendor. Skillsets included clinical practice, physics, software engineering, informaticists, FHIR developers, HL7 standards process experts, etc. Getting the right set of people together at the right times in the process can be challenging. It’s ideal to have redundancy among these roles, in case some people have to reduce their effort.</p>
      <p>The good news is that a promising Use Case has the potential to attract new participants. These participants appreciate the potential value of the work, are willing to invest resources to realize that value, and want to be at the table where decisions are made and work is executed.</p>

    <h3 id="value_prop">Value Propositions</h3>
      <p>CodeX experience suggests that different value propositions often resonate with different stakeholders. The following generalizes the values to a specialty data standardization initiative for involvement six different types of stakeholders, and the value propositions that often resonate with the same stakeholders.</p>

      <div class="community-growth-items">
      <!-- =========================================== -->
      <h4>Providers, Health Systems & Associated Specialty Societies</h4>
      <p class="stakeholder-value">Value to the specialty standardization initiative of engagement by these stakeholders</p>

        <li>Providing experts who can offer deep clinical knowledge</li>
        <li>Customers of vendors, who they can demand to implement the standards</li>
        <li>Potential funding</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="stakeholder-value">Value to these stakeholders to engage in the specialty initiative</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As the implementers of care quality improvements through SHR, provider partnerships will bring discoveries made in mCODE to informed patient care. </li>
        <li>Providers understand the gaps in care and how best to leverage lessons learned from the point of care to inform the SHR development and accelerating improvements based on standardize data. </li>
        <li>SHR aims to empower shared decision-making between patients and providers. </li>
      </ul>
