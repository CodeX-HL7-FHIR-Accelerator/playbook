    <h2>High-level Summary</h2>
    <p class="lead">The CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator Community has gathered substantial experience in not only a developing global data standard for cancer care – the minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) –  but also deploying and demonstrating value for solving specific problems faced by cancer patients and others. These outcomes and the experience  gained are shared on this site so other specialties might learn, and even collaborate, so that the sum of standards created for multiple specialties enables every person to have a coherent, lifetime Standard Health Record that improves health care and research for all.

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>The approach that has emerged from the CodeX Community can be summarized along five tracks that typically overlap in time and evolve with experience:</p>
    <p><%= image_tag '5_steps.png', :width => '100%', :class => 'py-5' %></p>

    <ol class="section-list">
      <li><%= link_to("Building the Community", "community.html") %>, including committed leadership with a broad reach; a fair and sustainable governance framework; and a growing group of diverse participants and skillsets. Certain organizations and skills are typically needed only at certain points in the work. </li>
      <li><%= link_to("Planning the work", "planning_use_cases.html") %>, including prioritizing Use Cases (specific challenges, proposed new work and data flows); organizing and scheduling work right through to adoption and measuring value, and securing the resources (organizations, people/skills) needed to succeed. Specific Use Cases attract specific subsets of each specialty.</li>
      <li><%= link_to("Standards Development", "standards.html") %>, based on compiling clinical experts’ requirements to address Use Case; incorporating these into HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Implementation Guides (FHIR IGs) – increasingly demanded and required for data exchange) – based on a set of design principles considered during the development of mCODE;  and after testing and update, standardizing, updating, and maintaining the FHIR IGs within Health Level Seven (HL7).</li>
      <li><%= link_to("Implementation", "implementation.html") %> of the FHIR IG(s) into systems (general commercial) and workflows; Testing  of the end-ultimately within the types organizations ultimately planned to host, use, and benefit from the work; and use feedback from testing to update Planning and Standards work, and to eventually demonstrate potential value of the work. These demonstrations often attract additional participants to the Community.</li>
      <li><%= link_to("Adoption", "adoption.html") %> in the real world is best driven by understanding at the Planning track what factors will move the market – including user demands, Government mandates, quality standards, and hopefully the promise of improved care and research during testing. It’s critical to Measure such improvements in the real world, to see where changes could make solutions even better (quality, cost, time) and help other participants engage.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This site also provides a Getting Started set of the five most important considerations [currently slide 7 – or could summarize this in a list of titles here], from the CodeX experience, for those potentially getting ready to start work on a new specialty. Background on the CodeX Community, mCODE standard, and the Case Study around the evolution of both and deployment in the real world are also summarized here.</p>
