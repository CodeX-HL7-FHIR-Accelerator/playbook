      <p>Lessons for medical specialties from MITRE's experience within the <%= link_to("CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home") %> and in other fora working with the community to  pioneer the <%= link_to("minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %> data standard, applying mCODE to solve real-world problems, and speeding adoption and value to patients.</p>

    <h2>High-level Summary</h2>
    <p class="lead">The CodeX HL7 FHIR Accelerator Community has gathered substantial experience in a developing global data standard for cancer care – the <%= link_to("minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)","https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE") %>. CodeX has also gained experience deploying and demonstrating the value of mCODE for solving specific problems faced by cancer patients and others stakeholders. MITRE's perspective and experience are shared on this site to help other specialties leverage what’s been learned. If specialties could follow the CodeX approach in a collaborative way, this could help ensure that the sum of standards created across multiple specialties enables every person to have a coherent, lifetime Standard Health Record that improves health care and research for all.

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>The approach that has emerged from the CodeX Community can be summarized along five tracks that typically overlap in time and evolve with experience:</p>
    <p><%= image_tag '5_steps.png', :width => '100%', :class => 'py-5' %></p>

    <ol class="section-list">
      <li><%= link_to("Community Building", "community.html") %>, including committed leadership with a broad reach; a fair and sustainable governance framework; and a growing group of diverse participants and skillsets. Certain organizations and skills are typically needed only at certain points in the work. </li>
      <li><%= link_to("Use Cases & Planning", "use_cases_planning.html") %>, including prioritizing Use Cases (specific challenges, proposed new work and data flows); organizing and scheduling work right through to adoption and measuring value; and securing the resources (organizations, people/skills) needed to succeed. Specific Use Cases attract specific subsets of each specialty.</li>
      <li><%= link_to("Standards Development", "standards.html") %>, based on compiling clinical experts’ requirements to address Use Cases; incorporating these into HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Implementation Guides (FHIR IGs) – increasingly demanded and required for data exchange) – based on a set of design principles considered during the development of mCODE;  and standardizing, updating (based on experience), and maintaining the FHIR IGs within Health Level Seven (HL7).</li>
      <li><%= link_to("Implementation & Testing", "implementation.html") %> Implementation of the FHIR IG(s) into systems (generally commercial) and workflows; Testing of systems and workflows within the types organizations ultimately planned to host, use, and benefit from the work; and feedback from testing to update Planning and Standards work, and to eventually demonstrate potential value of the work. These demonstrations often attract additional participants to the Community.</li>
      <li><%= link_to("Adoption & Value", "adoption.html") %> in the real world is best driven by understanding at the Planning track what factors will move the market – including user demands, Government mandates, quality standards, and hopefully the promise of improved care and research during testing. It’s critical to Measure such improvements in the real world, to see where changes could make solutions even better (quality, cost, time) and help other participants engage.</li>
